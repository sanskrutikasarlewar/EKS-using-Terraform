#Conclusion
#In this tutorial, you have learned how to containerize a Redis Flask application using Docker Compose. We started by building a simple Python Flask application and #implemented Redis for caching. Then, we created a Dockerfile that was used to containerize the Python Flask application. We also created a `docker-compose.yml` for #adding and configuring the applicationâ€™s containers as services. Finally, we launched the two containers at once using `docker-compose up` and accessing the #application on http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
